# vrs-magenta-poc

## __PROBLEM__

Today, there is no straightforward way to deploy a skill or voice application on multiple conversation platforms. Interoperability is pretty much non-existent.

We will cover two use cases:
1. Small companies that do not have their conversation platform
2. Big enterprise companies that can afford their conversation platform

## __EXPECTED OUTCOMES__
- Deliver VRS and Magenta integration
- Understand the latency criteria between VRS and Magenta
- Understand the minimum viable contract between VRS and Magenta

## __OUT OF SCOPE__
- Privacy and Security are not part of the POC
- Latency
